# Building-Quiz-Application-

The python is used to build a quiz-taking program and test each feature. It starts with designing the basic features of the application and finishes successfully with the application that the user with a menu-driven interface, administers the quizzes, and saves the results to a file. Once the app is built, he demonstrates ways to improve the app and add new features, like presenting the questions in random order and measuring the amount of time it takes a user to complete the quiz.
